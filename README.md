This is Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree's 6th project, Feed Reader. 

In this project I used:
- Jasmine https://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction.html

1. SETUP 

  1.1 First you need to download all the files. You can do this manually by clicking on "Clone or download" > "Download Zip". You can also       clone the files with GitHub, refer to https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository for more information.

  1.2 After you have downloaded all the files, you can run this app by opening index.html with a browser.
